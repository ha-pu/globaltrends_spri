# globaltrends SPRI
 A Google Trends-Based Socio-Political Risk Measure

We propose a concept of grassroots socio-political risk (SPR) and provide a the **globaltrends SPRI** as a measure for it. The **globaltrends SPRI** is based on individual-level issue salience using data from [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/). Our concept provides a bottom-up complement to established measures that focus more on political institutional players and the institutional constraints they face. The **globaltrends SPRI** can serve to predict institutional change in a country initiated by a popular majority of individuals. In contrast to existing measures, the **globaltrends SPRI** measure captures issue salience directly among individuals rather than media or analyst reports. As such, it is uniquely representative of socio-political sentiment, timely, and widely available. Our concept and measure offer novel opportunities for international business researchers. Refer to the accompanying [paper](add link) published in *Journal of International Management* for further information on the index construction.
